### Problem 6.18

For a continuous random variable $X$, the number $m$ such that $P (X ≤ m) = 1/2$ is called the median of X.

(a) Find the median of an Exp(λ) distribution.

(b) Give a simplified expression for the difference between the mean and the median. Is the difference positive or negative?
 
#### Answer

$$ F(X) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} $$
